# Bandit

[1.12.2 Edition](https://github.com/ElytraServers/Bandit)

Get your ores like a Bandit.

Yet Another Ore Vein Mining Mod, inspired by [Qz-Miner](https://github.com/QuanhuZeYu/Qz-Miner).

## Install

Requires **Forgelin**, **CodeChickenCore** and **GTNHLib**.

### GTNH 2.8.X

_Everything should be good._

### GTNH 2.7.X

- Update [Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases) to at least `2.0.0-GTNH`.

### Older GTNH Versions

Not supported!

## Usage

To start, you need to bind a keybinding for Bandit to enable, because there is no default keybinding for you, to reduce
keybinding duplication.

And when you press the key you just bind, you'll see some information on the top left, with green "Activating".
In this state, you can start the vein mining. But I'd recommend you to customize the settings first.

Pressing the key with either Shift or Ctrl will open a menu, selecting the Executor (or Scanning Mode in general) and
the Block Filter, by mouse scrolling.

Keep in mind, the vein mining task won't stop even if your Pickaxe in hand is broken. So get a tool that has
enough durability before starting the vein mining. Also, you can change the tool in hand while vein mining.

If you want to stop an ongoing vein mining task, you can use command `/bandit stop`. But it is not retroactive, which
you cannot undo the vein mining.

### Executor

Currently, we have 4 executors.

- [Manhattan]: The basic one, where it scans the DIRECTLY connected neighbor blocks within 8-block range from the
  center, globular.
- [Manhattan+]: The slightly advanced one of Manhattan, it scans the neighbor blocks within the 3x3x3 area, also within
  8-block range from the center.
- [Manhattan Large]: The larger version of Manhattan+, which it scans the blocks within 16-block range from the center.
- [Large-scan]: The largest scanner, which it scans all the blocks within a cube radius of 32 from the center. It is
  designed for ore mining, which the block clusters are not directly connected to each other. It starts from a vertex of
  the cube, so don't worry.

### Block Filter

- [All]: Just, all.
- [Matching Block]: Matches the block, and ignoring the block metadata.
- [Matching Block and Metadata]: Matches the block and the metadata.

### Drop Options

The options to control the drop position and timing. This option is for each player separately.

See details below.

#### Drop Position

You can change this option by `/bandit drop_pos [dropPosition]`.

This is used to determine which position to drop the harvested items and xp orbs.

- [DROP_AT_START]: Drop at the position where the vein mining starts, the first block you broke.
- [DROP_TO_PLAYER]: Drop to the player who started the vein mining, which is YOU.

#### Drop Timing

You can change this option by `/bandit drop_timing [dropTiming]`.

This is used to determine which timing to drop the harvested items and xp orbs.

- [IMMEDIATELY]: Drop the harvested items and xp orbs as soon as they are harvested.
- [EVENTUALLY]: Drop the harvested items and xp orbs when the vein mining is finished.\
  Notice that the items will be merged into a _BIG_ itemstack with amount of possibly more than 64. This can be very
  useful when the harvested items are going to be thousands, and rendering dropping items are destroying your PC.
- [ITEM_IMMEDIATELY_XP_EVENTUALLY]: The combination of the above two.
